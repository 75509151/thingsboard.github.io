<h1 class="aboutus-title">About Us</h1>

<h1 class="who-we-are">Who we are?</h1>
<p class="company-info">ThingsBoard, Inc. was founded in 2016. Yes, we are young (Gen Alpha indeed) but mature and independent. We develop IoT software products under ThingsBoardâ„¢ umbrella.
   Our flagship IoT platform in its class is the most popular open-source project. ThingsBoard's freeware and licensed software is widely used (successfully) by both IoT
   enthusiasts who design and prototype their smart solutions in their garages, or industrial customers with a wide range of requirements for device management,
   data processing, security, privacy, analysis, etc.<br/><br/>
   ThingsBoard, Inc. evolved from a startup with 2 employees to a renowned IoT enabler for hundreds of licensees and thousands of community users for a very short period. Currently,
   our R&D office is in Kyiv, Ukraine. However, the company is growing and new offices will appear in the future. Stay in touch with us.
