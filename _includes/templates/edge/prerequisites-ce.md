To start using ThingsBoard **Edge** you need to have ThingsBoard **Community Edition** server that supports edge functionality up and running. The easiest way is to use [Live Demo](https://demo.thingsboard.io/signup) server, that is already updated to the required version.

The alternative option is to install ThingsBoard **Community Edition** server that supports edge functionality on-premise.
Please visit [Upgrade instructions for ThingsBoard Community Edition server](/docs/edge/upgrade-server/) to install **3.3beta** version of ThingsBoard **Community Edition** server that supports edge functionality before the official **3.3** ThingsBoard Community Edition server release.
