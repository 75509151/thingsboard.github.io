## Prerequisites

You will need to have ThingsBoard CE server that supports **edge** functionality up and running.
The easiest way is to use [Live Demo](https://demo.thingsboard.io/signup) server, that is already updated to the required version.

Additionally, you will need to have ThingsBoard Edge up and running and connected to the ThingsBoard CE server.

Please install ThingsBoard Edge using [Installation Guide](/docs/edge/install/installation-options/) - this guide will help you to install ThingsBoard Edge and connect it to ThingsBoard CE server.

ThingsBoard **CE** server UI will be available using the URL: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
You may use username **tenant@thingsboard.org** and password **tenant**.

ThingsBoard **Edge** UI will be available using the URL: [http://localhost:18080](http://localhost:18080).
You may use the same username **tenant@thingsboard.org** and password **tenant** to log in.
