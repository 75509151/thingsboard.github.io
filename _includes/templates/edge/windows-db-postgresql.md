ThingsBoard Edge supports only PostgreSQL database management system.

Download the installation file (PostgreSQL 9.6+ or newer releases) [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads#windows) and follow the installation instructions.

During PostgreSQL installation, you will be prompted for superuser (postgres) password.
Don't forget this password. It will be used later. For simplicity, we will substitute it with "postgres".
