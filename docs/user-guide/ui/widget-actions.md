## Introduction

Actions feature can be treated as navigation among dashboard's states or between different dashboards.
Actions allow quickly and easily configuring the transition to created state, transferring to other dashboards, or even updating the dashboard you are in. 
Depending on the widget, the action sources differ. However, the type of action you are able to choose will be the same for all widgets.

Actions are adjusted in the Edit mode of the needed widget.

To fully understand how to use Actions, you have to add a State to your widget. How to do this you should [read here](/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#states).

## Action sources 

_Actions sources_ is an act that must be performed for the action type to work. Action sources are different for all widgets. 
Action sources will be explained for each widget separately using an example of the most commonly used type of action "Navigate to new dashboard state". 
How to use action sources you can read below in a manual of a needed widget.

## Types of action

_Types of action_ define which exactly action will be taken.
There are five action types that are the same for all widgets.
Learn more about action types with the [Entity Cards widget](/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions/#entity-table-widgets-action-types) examples.

##### Navigate to new dashboard state

States are so-called levels that allow you to navigate between different devices, assets, and widget objects to see the information you need in more detail.
When choosing _Navigate to new dashboard state_ action type, you will be transferred to the previously created state of your choice. 
How to add states to your dashboard, please [read here](/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#states).

##### Update current dashboard state

While  using a dashboard, you can view detailed information about a specific device/asset in real-time. Most commonly used with Chart widgets.

##### Navigate to other dashboard

This type of action transfers you to a previously created dashboard of your choice. 

##### Custom action

A Custom action allows manually entering a function that can be used to add an individual action to your widget (for example deleting listed devices/assets).

##### Custom action (with HTML template)

A Custom action with HTML template allows manually entering a function in an existing HTML template (for example creating dialog windows and opportunity to edit listed devices/assets). 


## Entity Table widget actions

Please, [learn here](/docs/getting-started-guides/helloworld/#step-33-add-table-widget) how to add an Entity Table widget to your dashboard. 

To add an action to your Entity Table widget: 
- Go to the Dashboard's edit mode;
- Click a "Pencil" icon in the upper right corner of the widget;
- Choose the last cell "Actions" and click the "Plus" symbol on the right of the window.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-sources" %}

#### Entity Table action sources

Action source is a particular act that needs to be done to achieve an aim. Action sources of Cards widgets vary depending on the used widget.  
**All of the action sources will be shown with an example of ["Navigate to new dashboard state"](/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions/#navigate-to-new-dashboard-state) action type.**

###### 1. Action cell button
  
Clicking an icon that's been chosen as a button executes an action. To configure _Action cell button_ action source, you should:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".  
2. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.  
3. In the top drop-down menu, choose an _Action cell button_ action source.  
4. In the next line input a name for the action and choose an icon that will represent a button. With this button an action will be performed.  
5. Since the example for all the action sources is "Navigate to new dashboard state" action type, choose it in the drop-down Type menu.  
6. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard state" appears. Select a previously created state you'd like to be transitioned to. 
7. When all needed settings are configured, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.  
8. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source, icon and action type.
9. Apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window. 
10. Save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

As you see, opposite each of entity names is chosen action cell button. By clicking this button the action will be executed, namely transition to the chosen state.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-cellbutton" %}

###### 2. Widget header button 
  
Button appears in the header of the widget. Clicking this button executes an action.
Widget header button is the most commonly used action source, and it can be found in all widgets. To configure the _Widget header button_ action source, you should:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".
2. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.
3. In the top drop-down menu, choose an _Widget header button_ action source.
4. In the next line input a name for the action and choose an icon that will represent a button. With this button an action will be performed.
5. Since the example for all the action sources is "Navigate to new dashboard state" action type, choose it in the drop-down Type menu.
6. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard state" appears. Select a previously created state you'd like to be transitioned to.
7. When all needed settings are configured, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.
8. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source, icon and action type.
9. Apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.
10. Save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

As you see now, in the header of the widget has appeared a button-icon. After you click it, an action will be performed, namely transition to the chosen state.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-widgetheaderbutton" %}

###### 3. On row click 
  
Clicking on the row of the Table widget executes an action. To configure the _On row click_ action source, you should:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".
2. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.
3. In the top drop-down menu, choose an _On row click_ action source.
4. Enter the name of the action in the appropriate line.
5. Using this action source, there won't be any buttons on the widget, therefore we shouldn't select an icon.
6. Since the example for all the action sources is "Navigate to new dashboard state" action type, choose it in the drop-down Type menu.
7. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard state" appears. Select a previously created state you'd like to be transitioned to.
8. When all needed settings are configured, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.
9. Now, you see configured action, so you can double check action source and action type.
10. Apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.
11. Save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

To execute an action, namely to be transitioned to the chosen state, just click any of the rows of your Table widget.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-onrowclick" %}

###### 4. On row double click 
  
Double-clicking any row of the Entity table widget executes an action. To configure the _On row double click_ action source, you should:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".
2. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.
3. In the top drop-down menu, choose an _On row double click_ action source.
4. Enter the name of the action in the appropriate line.
5. Using this action source, there won't be any buttons on the widget, therefore we shouldn't select an icon.
6. Since the example for all the action sources is "Navigate to new dashboard state" action type, choose it in the drop-down Type menu.
7. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard state" appears. Select a previously created state you'd like to be transitioned to.
8. After configuring all needed settings, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.
9. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source and action type.
10. Apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.
11. Save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

To execute an action, namely to be transitioned to the chosen state, just double click any of the rows of your Table widget.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-onrowdoubleclick" %}

###### 5. On node selected (only in Entities Hierarchy widget)

When Entites Hierarchy widget was added, you should configure a hierarchy itself. How to do it, please, [learn here](/docs/user-guide/entities-and-relations/#step-1-provision-entities-and-relations). 
After relations were added, go to the edit mode of the Entities Hierarchy widget. To configure the _On node selected_ action source:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell called "Actions".
2. Click the "+" icon in right of the window to add a new action.
3. In the top drop-down menu, choose an _On node selected_ action source.
4. Since the example for all the action sources is "Navigate to new dashboard state" action type, choose it in the drop-down Type menu.
5. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard state" appears. Select a previously created state you'd like to be transitioned to.
6. After configuring all needed settings, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.
7. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source and action type.
8. Apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.
9. Save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

To perform an action you should click any of the nodes in the Entities hierarchy. 

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="onnode" %}

###### 6. On HTML element click (only in HTML Cards and Value Title widgets)

ThingsBoard has two widgets that you can configure fully by yourself by customizing an HTML code in their settings. When a code is written, it is possible to input an action source in it.  
How to add an action source to HTML Cards and Value Title widgets:

- **HTML Cards widget**

    1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell called "Actions".
    2. Click the "+" icon in right of the window to add a new action.
    3. In the top drop-down menu, choose an _On HTML element click_ action source.
    4. Input name of the action and be sure to remember it, because the action name will be used while configuring the HTML code.
    5. Since the example for all the action sources is "Navigate to new dashboard state" action type, choose it in the drop-down Type menu.
    6. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard state" appears. Select a previously created state you'd like to be transitioned to.
    7. After configuring all needed settings, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.
    8. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source and action type.
    9. Now move to the Advanced cell of the widget. There you should see two fields: CSS and HTML.
    10. In the HTML field enter an ID of the action which is its name. Since the name in the example is _test1_, the HTML code will look like this:

```ruby
<div id='test1' class='card'>HTML code here</div>
```

- Where _test1_ is the name of the action and _HTML code here_ is the text which is going to be shown on the HTML Card widget

Then apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.  
In the edit mode of the dashboard save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

To execute an action click anywhere in the widget. 

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="onhtml" %}

- **Value Title widget**

    1. In the widget's edit mode, move to the last cell called "Actions".
    2. Click the "+" icon in right of the window to add a new action.
    3. In the top drop-down menu, choose an _On HTML element click_ action source.
    4. Input name of the action and be sure to remember it, because the action name will be used while configuring the HTML code.
    5. Since the example for all the action sources is "Navigate to new dashboard state" action type, choose it in the drop-down Type menu.
    6. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard state" appears. Select a previously created state you'd like to be transitioned to.
    7. After configuring all needed settings, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.
    8. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source and action type.
    9. Now move to the Advanced cell of the widget. There you should see two fields with already written code: CSS and HTML.
    10. For example let's configure an action that executes by clicking the wisget's header. In the HTML field find a header tag and enter an ID of your action there. Since the name in the example is _test2_, the HTML code will look like this:

```ruby
<h1 id='test2'>Value title</h1>
```

- Where _test2_ is a name of the action and _Value title_ is the text that will be shown in the widget's header.

Then apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.  
In the edit mode of the dashboard save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

To execute an action click the widget's header.

#### Entity Table widget's Action types 

There are exist five action types. **Action types are the same for all widgets.**
Therefore, since the action types are the same for all widgets, this tutorial will use the Action Cell Button action source to explain all action types, 
and they will be explained using the Entity Cards widget as an example.

- **[Navigate to new dashboard state](/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions/#navigate-to-new-dashboard-state)**

To use this action type, firstly you need to add a state to your dashboard. What is state and how to add it, please, [learn here](/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#states). 
After a state has been added, we can configure a _Navigate to new dashboard state_ action type:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".
2. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.
3. As an example for this manual, in the top drop-down menu, choose an "Action cell button" action source.
4. In the next line input a name for the action and choose an icon that will represent a button. With this button, action will be performed.
5. In the drop-down menu "Type", choose a _Navigate to new dashboard state_ action type.
6. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard state" appears. Select a previously created state you'd like to be transitioned to.
7. When a desired state has been selected, click the "Add" button in the bottom of the "Add action" window.
8. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source, icon and action type.
9. Apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.
10. Save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

After saving changes, you can see an icon-button opposite the entity names. Clicking any of these icons will bring you to the previously selected state.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="navigate-new-state-cards" %}

- **[Update current dashboard state](/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions/#update-current-dashboard-state)**

This action type allows updating a dashboard that you are currently on. 
The most common use of this action type is through chart widgets where you can see the details more accurately.
For starters let's add a Chart widget to the Dashboard to configure the _Update current dashboard state_ action type:

1. Enter Dashboard's Edit mode and in the drop-down "Select widget" menu choose Charts: Timeseries - Flot.
2. In the "Add widget" window type input your datasource, in this manual for example is used pressure data. Click "Add" in the right bottom of the widget.
3. We can see that Chart widget has appeared on the dashboard, but it has no data to display yet.
4. Enter Edit mode of the Table widget by clicking the Pencil icon in the right top of the widget.
5. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".
6. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.
7. As an example for this manual, in the top drop-down menu, choose an "Action cell button" action source.
8. In the next line input a name for the action and choose an icon that will represent a button. With this button, action will be performed.
9. In the drop-down menu "Type", choose a _Update current dashboard state_ action type.
10. After choosing an action type, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.
11. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source, icon and action type.
12. Apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.
13. Save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

After saving changes, you can see icon-buttons opposite the entity names. Clicking any of these icons will update details of the entity and they will be shown on the Chart widget on the current dashboard.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="update-current-dash-state" %}

- **[Navigate to other dashboard](/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions/#navigate-to-other-dashboard)**

To be fastly transitioned to another selected dashboard, you should:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".
2. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.
3. As an example for this manual, in the top drop-down menu, choose an "Action cell button" action source.
4. In the next line input a name for the action and choose an icon that will represent a button. With this button, action will be performed.
5. In the drop-down menu "Type", choose a _Navigate to other dashboard_ action type.
6. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard" appears. Select a previously created dashboard you'd like to be transitioned to. 
Notice that it's also possible to be transitioned to the existed state in the chosen dashboard.
7. After configuring an action type, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.
8. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source, icon and action type.
9. Apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.
10. Save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

After saving changes, you can see icon-buttons opposite the entity names. Clicking any of these icons will transfer you to the previously selected dashboard (or chosen state in that dashboard).

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="navigate-to-dash-cards" %}

- **[Custom action](/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions/#custom-action)**

To configure a custom action with a function (with an example of an asset deletion):

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".
2. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.
3. As an example for this manual, in the top drop-down menu, choose an "Action cell button" action source.

{
  let $injector = widgetContext.$scope.$injector;
  let dialogs = $injector.get(widgetContext.servicesMap.get('dialogs'));
  let assetService = $injector.get(widgetContext.servicesMap.get('assetService'));

  openDeleteAssetDialog();

  function openDeleteAssetDialog() {
  let title = "Are you sure you want to delete the asset " + entityName +  "?";
  let content = "Be careful, after the confirmation, the asset and all related data will become unrecoverable!";
  dialogs.confirm(title, content, 'Cancel', 'Delete').subscribe(
  function (result) {
  if (result) {
  deleteAsset();
}
}
);
}

function deleteAsset() {
assetService.deleteAsset(entityId.id).subscribe(
function () {
widgetContext.updateAliases();
}
);
}
}
```

## Charts widget actions

Chart widget displays multiple historical values of the same data key. 
How to add chart widget to your dashboard you should learn [here](/docs/getting-started-guides/helloworld/#step-34-add-chart-widget).  

To add an action to your Chart widget, go to the Dashboard's edit mode, then click a "Pencil" icon in the upper right corner of the widget itself.
Choose the last cell "Actions" and click the "Plus" symbol on the right of the window.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="chart-editmode" %}

#### Chart widget action sources

Action source is a particular act that needs to be done to achieve an aim. 

##### 1. Widget header button

Chart widget has one action source. It's a _Widget header button_.
After choosing this action source, you need to select an icon that will be placed on the header of the widget. Action will be performed after clicking this icon-button.

To configure Chart widget header button, you should:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".
2. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.
3. In the top drop-down menu, choose an _Widget header button_ action source.
4. In the next line input a name for the action and choose an icon that will represent a button. With this button an action will be performed.
5. Since the example for all the action sources is "Navigate to new dashboard state" action type, choose it in the drop-down Type menu.
6. After choosing an action type, the drop-down menu "Target dashboard state" appears. Select a previously created state you'd like to be transitioned to.
7. When all needed settings are configured, click "Add" in the right bottom of the "Add action" window.
8. Now you see configured action, so you can double check action source, icon and action type.
9. Apply changes by clicking orange tick icon in the top right of the window and then close the details window.
10. Save applied changes by clicking the orange tick icon "Apply changes" in the bottom right of the screen.

Perform an action by clicking a button in the right of the widget's header.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="charts-source-whb" %}


#### Chart widget action types

Since action types are the same for all widgets, 
take a look [how to use and configure action types](/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-actions/#entity-table-widgets-action-types) with an example of the Entity Cards widget.


## Map widget actions

#### Adding a Map widget

Let's start from adding a Map widget. Go to the dashboard where your Map will be placed and click a bottom right "Pencil" icon:
- **If you have an empty new dashboard**, you need to just click message in the middle "Add a new widget" and in the drop-down menu at the end of the list, choose "Maps". 
  Then, add a Datasource of your widget and click "Add".
- **If some widgets were added before to this dashboard**, click the "Paper" icon ("Create new widget"). 
In the drop-down menu list to the end of the list to choose "Maps". Finally, add a Datasource of your widget and click "Add".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="map-creation" %}

#### Adding an action to the Map widget

Now it's time to add an action. To do this you should click the "Pencil" icon in the right top of the Map widget to enter the "Edit widget" mode.
Navigate to the "Action" cell and there click the "+" icon in the right of the screen. The "Add action" window will be opened.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="navigate-to-actions-map" %}

#### Map widget action sources

Action source is an act that needs to be done to achieve a certain goal. You have to choose it in the drop-down menu in the top of the window. 
A Map widget has five types of action sources that execute an action in different ways.

**Please note**: all actions explanations assume that you have already added states to your widget. If not, please do so. How to do it [read here](/docs/user-guide/dashboards/#states).

##### 1. Widget header button
   
Adding a button on the header of your widget. The action will be executed when you click on the icon. To configure a widget header button for the Map widget, you should:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the last cell "Actions".

##### 3. On polygon click

Polygon is a plane figure that’s described by a finite number of dots. We use polygon which is based on coordinates that are specified within the device we use, but you can use any other entity.
You may mark your assets and any other entities with a polygon option. For the polygon, we can specify the next settings. Polygon coordinates are being received in a format:

```ruby
[[1CoordinateLatitude,1CoordinateLatitude],[2CoordinateLatitude,2CoordinateLatitude]...[nCoordinateLatitude,nCoordinateLatitude]]
```

where n - number of coordinates which polygon is described by.

To configure _On polygon click_ action source on the Map widget, you should:

1. In the widget's edit mode move to the cell "Advanced".
2. Scroll to the Polygon Settings, tick the checkbox "Show polygon".
3. Input Polygon key name and remember it, it's going to be used later.
4. Click an orange tick mark in the right top of the window to apply changes.
5. Click the right bottom tick icon to save the changes.
6. With the main left ThingsBoard menu go to Assets.
7. From the assets list select an asset you'd like to add polygon to and open it.
8. In the Assets details window, go to the Attributes cell.
9. Click the "+" icon to add a new attribute to the asset.
10. In the "Add attribute" window enter a Key - it must be the same Key as the Polygon key name.
11. Select Value Type "Strings" and input coordinates of the massive for your polygon. In the example we use random coordinates
```
[[37.758436,  -122.509429],[37.759834, -122.476874],[37.734690, -122.475170],[37.733531, -122.506271]]
```
12. In the "Add attribute" window click the right bottom button "Add".
13. Go back to the Dashboard with the Map widget.
14. Enter Dashboard's edit mode by clicking bottom right "Pencil" icon.
15. Click the "pencil" icon in the right top corner of the Map widget to enter its edit mode.
16. Add in the Datasources a data key that jusr been configured. Just start typing its name and it will be shown in the list.
17. After adding a new data key, apply changes.
18. Move to the last cell "Actions".
19. Click the "+" icon on right of the window to add a new action.
20. In the top drop-down menu, choose an _On polygon click_ action source.
