### Roles management

Each Edge Group can only belong to one owner. This may be either Tenant or Customer. 

As Tenant Administrator you are able to **manage roles and permissions** for user groups that will have access to ThingsBoard Edge features:
 * Manage flexible set of permissions to interact with devices, assets, entity views, dashboards.
 * Assign roles to specific user groups.
 
Here you can find more information about [**ThingsBoard roles management**](/docs/user-guide/rbac/).
