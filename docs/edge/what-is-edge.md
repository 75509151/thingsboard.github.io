#### ThingsBoard Edge features                                                       
                                                                
With **ThingsBoard Edge** you get the following benefits:

 - **Local deployment and storage** to operate with and store data from local devices without internet connection. Push updates to the cloud once connection restored.

 - **Local storage** to store data from the devices on the edge without internet connection to the cloud and push to the cloud updates once connection restored.

ThingsBoard Edge inherits features from ThingsBoard CE/PE to provide you the same experience how to connect, manage and process data from your devices.  

It supports next **ThingsBoard Community Edition** features:
 * [**Attributes**](/docs/user-guide/attributes/) - assign and manage custom attributes to your entities.
 * [**Telemetry**](/docs/user-guide/telemetry/) - API for collection of time-series data of your devices.
 * [**Entities and relations**](/docs/user-guide/entities-and-relations/) - model physical world objects (e.g. devices and assets) and relations between them.
 * [**Data visualization**](/docs/guides#AnchorIDDataVisualization) - develop custom dashboards and widgets.
 * [**Rule engine**](/docs/edge/features/edge-rule-engine/) - manage data processing & actions on incoming telemetry and events.
 * [**RPC**](/docs/user-guide/rpc/) - send remote procedure calls (RPC) **both from edge and cloud sides** to devices and vice versa.
 * [**Audit log**](/docs/user-guide/audit-log/) - track user activity.
 * [**API Limits**](/docs/user-guide/api-limits/) - control and limit number of API requests from single host.

As well ThingsBoard Edge supports major **ThingsBoard PE** features:
 * [**White-labeling**](/docs/user-guide/white-labeling/) - allows you to configure a custom menu, logo, color scheme, email server settings, customer email templates to interact with the users etc.
 * [**Scheduler**](/docs/user-guide/scheduler/) - allows you to schedule various types of events with flexible schedule configuration.
 * [**Entity Groups**](/docs/user-guide/groups/) - allows you to organize entities into groups, assign roles to specific user group, grant specific permissions to specific user groups over specific device groups.

#### Architecture

ThingsBoard Edge designed to be:

* **scalable**: spread your computation and data analysis on thousands of edges.
* **robust and efficient**: single edge can handle up to 1000 of devices depending on the [use-case](/docs/edge/use-cases/overview/) and deployed hardware.
* **customizable**: adding new functionality is easy with customizable widgets and rule engine nodes.
* **durable**: edge collects all messages and events in the persistence layer. Particular messages could be transferred to the cloud, if required.

**Device Connectivity**

ThingsBoard Edge provides support for standard ThingsBoard CE/PE device communication protocols:
* [**HTTP API**](/docs/reference/http-api/)
* [**MQTT API**](/docs/reference/mqtt-api/)
* [**CoAP API**](/docs/reference/coap-api/)

![image](/images/edge/overview/edge_architecture.svg)

**Technologies and Frameworks**

* **Client-side**: Angular.js/React or Angular 9+
* **Server-side**: Java, Spring
* **Database**: PostgreSQL
* **Protocols**: HTTP(S), MQTT, CoAP
* **Cloud connectivity**: gRPC(SSL)

**Security**

Autogenerated pair of **Key** and **Secret** is a default way to securely connect ThingsBoard Each to cloud instance using gRPC protocol. 

For additional security gRPC connection could be established on top of **SSL** technology.
