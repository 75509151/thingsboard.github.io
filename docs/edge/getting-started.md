In order to use ThingsBoard Edge you will need to have ThingsBoard CE server that supports Edge functionality up and running. The easiest way is to use [Live Demo](https://demo.thingsboard.io/signup) server, that is already updated to the required version.

Please visit [Upgrade instructions for ThingsBoard CE server](/docs/edge/install/upgrade-ce-server/) to install **3.3beta** version of ThingsBoard CE server that supports Edge functionality before the official **3.3** ThingsBoard CE server release.
